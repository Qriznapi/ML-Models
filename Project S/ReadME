Here is a project for the sales prediction purposes. We have sales volumes of the several product lines over the past 5 years. 
The goal is to predict the sales for the next 3 months using the sale volume per day data minimizing each month predicted sales deviation. 
Since there is no clear way how to prevent the model from overfitting we will create different types of models and choose median predicted sales for each month. So there are 2 Deep Learning: CNN, LSTM and 1 Machine Learning model - XG-boost.

CNN models were the most incosistent with different periods of time models. They are highly dependent on the hyperparameters and month prediction deviation ranges from max 5% to 20% based on time period chosen.

LSTM models are the most interesting and succesfull. They manage to consistently predict sales with the max deviation of 7%. LSTM models perfomance depends less on the hyperparameters unlike CNN models and they are believed to save the trends better than other DL models. Yet there is likely some overfitting to the test.

XG-boost has a great speed of training advantage over DL models as it trains 100 times faster (2-3 sec VS 4 min). Due to this fact it is much easier to optimize and find the best configuration for this algorithm. Unlike DL models XG-boost also shows good consistency on different data periods and seems safe from overfitting. This comes at the cost of the model perfomance as its deviation tends go up to 10 % for 2 out of 3 months predicted.

Overall combination of LSTM and XG-boost is the most succesfull and consistent of the models available.
